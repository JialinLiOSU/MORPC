This folder contains a Visio to show the data manipulation process, as well as the R script used to analyze the data. 

There are four files uploaded to BuckeyeBox: 
*MOPRC Production Data: Original File from EPA
*MORPC Production Data_cleaned: File from EPA with adjusted water production values / years
*MORPC Seller Buyer List: Shows who buys water from whom
*Cleaned County Water Population 2010-2019: Dataset with total water produced, population, and water per person per year by county as well as 15-county region

Although the data has been processed, some public water system data seems strange. My plan is to reach out the these organizations to check if the values are accuarate. If/when I get updated values, I will upload a new file to the BuckeyeBox.
