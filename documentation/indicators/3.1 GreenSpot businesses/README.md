# 3.1 GreenSpot businesses

## Data

According to Natalie Hurst, as of 10/24/2019 the GreenSpot business data must be requested manually from the City of Columbus GreenSpot coordinator.  

In the long run, assume that the data workflow will be triggered in one of the following ways:

  1. MORPC will make the data available to CURA at a public URL.  MORPC will update the data in-place (i.e. replace the existing spreadsheet with a new one of the same name) periodically.  CURA will download and process the data according to a regular schedule.

  2. As new data becomes available, MORPC will push/upload the new spreadsheet using the data ingestion API

For development purposes, sample data is available in BuckeyeBox:

CURA > Projects > MORPC Regional Sustainability Dashboard > Sample data > [3.1 GreenSpot businesses](https://osu.box.com/s/0rwve4g360p0ycds4c4h34mge7tjndom)
