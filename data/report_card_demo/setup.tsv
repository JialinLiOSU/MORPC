goal_1_1	goal_1	1.1	Reduce vehicle miles traveled	Reduce vehicle miles traveled	0	10000	line	2020	8971	2016	9443	Vehicle miles traveled per capita is a measure of traffic volumes over distance relative to population.  The growing region still relies heavily on cars, and has only varied incrementally in recent years.  Between 2013 and 2015* there was a drop of 3%.  However, since then, VMT has crept back up, keeping pace with population growth.
goal_1_2a	goal_1	1.2a	Reduce commuters driving alone	Reduce the percentage of commuters driving alone	0.7	0.9	bar	2020	0.8	2016	0.82	A growing region means more people need to reach their destinations each day.  Recent estimates suggest little change in the share of commuters who drive alone, pointing to a continuing need to implement strategies that help residents rely less on their vehicles.
goal_1_2b	goal_1	1.2b	Increase commuters using alternative modes	Increase the percentage of commuters riding transit, bicycling, or walking	0	0.1	stackBar	2020	0.06	2016	0.048	One way MORPC and its partners are working to reduce congestion and encourage alternative modes of transportation is through the Downtown C-pass.  C-pass provides eligible downtown workers unlimited access to the entire bus system of Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA).  That means up to 45,000 eligible workers and residents can use the C-pass any day, any time, on any route.
goal_1_3	goal_1	1.3	Increase alternative fuel vehicles (simulated 'data')	Increase the percentage of vehicles using alternative fuels (simulated 'data')	0	0.03	line	2020	0.025	-1	-1	The choice to buy an electric vehicle (EV) or alternative fuel vehicle si motivated, in part, by a consumer's confident that there will be a place to recharge or refuel when their energy runs low.  that's why MORPC is working toward creating a nationally-designated Alternative Fueld Corridor in Central Ohio.  The designation means signage for travelers as well as use of 'data' to strategically deploy future EV/AFV infrastructure.  This allows for more long-distance travel for those who own alternative fuel vehicles, as well as comfort knowing their sustainable choice won't leave them stranded.
goal_1_4	goal_1	1.4	Increase trail miles traveled	Increase the number of trail miles traveled annually	9000000	14000000	line	2020	13000000	2016	10990358	Trails are built to be used, and one of the most important indicators of the utility of a trail system is the level of use it receives.  Overall, trail miles traveled has increased 5% between 2014 and 2017.  The Alumn Creek Trail saw significant increases in use, in part due to recent efforts to fill in the gaps to make it a more contiguous route.  The Olentangy Trail remains one of the most congested trails in the network (with 2,805,600 miles traveled), which has prompted City of Columbus officials to expore expansion options.
goal_1_5	goal_1	1.5	Increase alternative fuel stations	Increase the number of alternative fuel stations	0	230	stackBar	2020	220	2016	147	The number of alternative fuel stations continues to grow.  While the rate of growth slowed in the past year, the trajectory toward the 2020 target is is still good.  Currently the region is only 25 shy of having 220 stations by 2020.  Electric vehicle charging stations currently dominate the alternative fuel mix, and saw the fastest rate of growth from 2015, followed by compressed natural gas.  As of October 2018, 35 applications for the AEP Ohio EV Charging Station Incentive Program have been received, representing 104 additional charging units.
goal_1_6	goal_1	1.6	Reduce energy consumption	Reduce per capita energy consumption across all sectors	0	30	bar	2020	14.5	2010	29	Our objective is a 50% reduction in the difference between the US average for energy consumption per person, and Central Ohio's average.  To reach this, the region will need to improve its energy effficiency by 5%.  Even though Central Ohio's average tends to improve year over year, so does the national average.
goal_1_7a	goal_1	1.7a	Increase renewable energy facilities	Increase local renewable energy projects	0	650	stackBar	2020	576	2016	463	Based on Public Utilities Commission of Ohio 'data' from June 2018, the region had a total of 231 MW of renewable electricity generating capacity, which includes solar, biomass, wind, solid-waste-to-energy, hydroelectric, landfill gas, and combined heat and power.  Capacity is a measure of generating potential.  While the rate of increase in the number of facilities has slowed in the past year, the rate of growth of newly installed capacity saw the biggest increase since 2013, owing to an increase in both solar and wind.
goal_1_7b	goal_1	1.7b	Increase renewable energy capacity	Increase local renewable energy generating capacity	0	300	stackBar	2020	278	2016	223	The number of renewable energy facilities continues to increase -- the region is within 5% of the 2020 target.  Solar installations dominate this measure by far, with 538 installations spread throughout 15 counties in Central Ohio. Solar capacity stands at 20 MW and has significant room for growth.
goal_2_1	goal_2	2.1	Reduce emissions	Reduce emissions to meet federal air quality standards	0	35	line	2020	0	-1	-1	Currently, Central Ohio is achieving the national standards for fine particulate matter  but not for ozone pollution.  Ozone pollution is created when emissions from sources such as cars and industry react chemically in the presence of heat and sunlight. The region is slightly over the threshold for ozone and so is in marginal non-attainment of the standards.  The latest assessment of air quality 'data' concluded in 2016 shows the region at 71 parts per billion (ppb), an improvement over the previous 2008 assessment at 77 ppb.
goal_2_2	goal_2	2.2	Increase air quality awareness	Increase the number of people receiving air quality information and education	1000000	2000000	line	2020	1846625	2016	1678750	Making sure the community knows when air pollution is a concern, and what to do to protect their health, is an important piece of our mission.  It is especially important that the message reaches people particularly sensitive to air pollution: individuals with lung diseases, older adults, and children.  Along with sending out air quality forecasts and alerts by email and 'text', communication partners are key for spreading the word through social media, TV, and radio when there is an Air Quality Alert.  Currently more than 1.5 million people are made aware of Air Quality Alerts through the Ohio Department of Transportation's highway Dynamic Message Signs.  This number increases by around 2% annually.  Communication partnerships with other organizations that help spread the message broadly, are trusted resources in our communities, and have access to especially vulnerable communities are continually being established to help amplify the Air Quality Alert message.
goal_2_3	goal_2	2.3	Reduce solid waste per person	Reduce the amount of municipal solid waste per capita disposed in the landfill	3	5	line	2020	4	2014	4.25	Despite many organizations' and communities' efforts, we are moving away from our target of waste reduction.  In fact, each person, on average, still consumes about 4.5 lbs per day.  It may not seem like much, but it adds up.  If we reach our 'goal', it would keep over 100,000 tons of solid waste out of landfills each year - that's the weight equivalent of 125 cars every single day.
goal_2_4	goal_2	2.4	Promote infill development	Minimize greenfield development and promote infill and redevelopment	0	1	bar	2020	0.5	2014	0.345	From 2010 to 2018, nearly 40% of development occurred inside the urban area.  Improvement between the baseline measure and recent years is a promising indicator of change in the right direction.  Consistent with insight2050 efforts, more Central Ohio communities are adopting focused growth approaches to planning and development.
